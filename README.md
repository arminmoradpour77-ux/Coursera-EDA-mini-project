# Coursera-EDA-mini-project

This repository contains the work for the “Data Preparation & Exploratory Data Analysis” mini-project from the Coursera course. The aim is to apply data cleansing, transformation and visualization techniques to a given dataset and extract meaningful insights.


Objective

1. The primary objectives of this mini-project are:

2. To perform thorough data preparation by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing or scaling numerical data, etc.

3. To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, relationships or anomalies.

4. To generate visualizations that support the analysis (histograms, box-plots, scatter plots, correlation matrix, etc).

5. To summarise findings and suggest next steps or actionable insights based on the data.



Workflow

1. The analysis in project_Data_prep_EDA.ipynb follows these main steps:

2. Import libraries & data ingestion – importing packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc) and reading the dataset.

3. Initial data exploration – checking dimensions, data types, summary statistics, missing values, unique categories.

4. Data cleaning & preparation – handling missing values (drop/impute), converting/encoding categorical variables, scaling or normalising if needed, feature creation.
Exploratory analysis & visualization – distribution of individual features, pairwise relationships, correlation analysis, group comparisons, outlier detection.
Key observations & summary of insights – listing what the EDA reveals and suggesting possible next steps or modelling considerations.
